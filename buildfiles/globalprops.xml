<!-- build.sysclasspath
     This is a "magic" property. The value of the build.sysclasspath
     property controls how the system classpath, ie. the classpath in
     effect when Ant is run, affects the behaviour of classpaths in
     Ant. The default behavior varies from Ant to Ant task.

     The values and their meanings are:
        only -   Only the system classpath is used and classpaths
                 specified in build files, etc are ignored. This
                 situation could be considered as the person running
                 the build file knows more about the environment
                 than the person writing the build file
        ignore - The system classpath is ignored. This situation is
                 the reverse of the above. The person running the
                 build trusts the build file writer to get the build
                 file right
        last -   The classpath is concatenated to any specified
                 classpaths at the end. This is a compromise, where
                 the build file writer has priority.
        first -  Any specified classpaths are concatenated to the
                 system classpath. This is the other form of compromise
                 where the build runner has priority.
