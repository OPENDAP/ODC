TO BUILD (Optional):

  In the Makefile:
   - edit JAVAC so it points to your java compiler
   - edit CLASSPATH so it includes either the base of your Java-DODS
     distribution or the location of dods.jar on your system.

  Type 'make' (If this doesn't work, try 'javac *.java').

TO INSTALL (Pick one):

  To install the provided jar files:
   - download dods.jar from the dods website
     (ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/dods/DODS-Java-1.0/dods.jar)
   - locate the file classpath.txt on your system.  This can be done
     by starting matlab and typing 'which classpath.txt'.
   - If you have write access to classpath.txt, add the locations of
     dods.jar and the provided matlab.jar to the file.  You'll have to
     restart matlab before the changes will take affect.
   - If you don't have write access to classpath.txt, copy the file 
     into the dods/clients/matlab/ directory and edit it there.  Matlab will
     read this file over the system default as long as you start it
     from the same directory.
   _ Add the directory with loaddods.m to your matlab path, and the client
     should work.

  To install the compiled .class files:
   - follow the same steps as above, however instead of adding matlab.jar
     to the classpath, add the directory you untarred the client into.
     (For example, if loaddods is in '~/Java-DODS/dods/clients/matlab',
      add '~/Java-DODS/' to classpath.txt).
