#Introduction
(howto file revised 28 April 2011)

This How-To resource explains how to do common tasks step by step. For in-depth help reference information see the Help tab.

Control tabs are referred to using a slash format. For example, "View/Data" means click the "View" tab (top row), then click the "Data" tab (a subtab of View).

#Create a Dataset Using Paste

One of the fastest ways to create a new dataset is to use a paste (Ctrl+V) action.

#How to Create a Two-Dimensional Array

1. Go to View/Data
2. Click the "New" dataset button
      - a new dataset named "Dataset" will appear in the combo box to the left of the button
	  - the new dataset is empty, its root is named "data" and can be seen in the "Dataset Structure" panel
	  - the root structure ("data") is automatically selected when the new dataset is created
3. Find the "Edit Variable" panel in the middle or mid-right of the screen
4. Verify that the variable type selector next to the blue "+" button is set to "Array"
5. Click the blue plus button "+"
	  - a new array is created with one dimension of 100 elements
	  - the array is of the type integer by default
	  - the values of the array are visible in the array viewer at the bottom of the screen
6. Click the "New" dimension button in the array editor
	  - a new dimension is added

#How to Create and Plot Data

Here is a simple example of creating and plotting a simple data set.

1. Create a two-dimensional array (see How To)
2. Go to the command bar of the array editor, field "exp:", type "$1+$2" (without quotes) and press enter
	  - new values appear in the array
	  - this expression tells the editor to make each cell the sum of its index values (row=$1 and column=$2)
3. Go to View/Plotter
4. Click "Dataset" in the data selector at the top left of the screen
5. Verify that the plot type is "Pseudocolor"
6. Click the "Plot to" button
	  - a rainbow-like plot will appear
	  
#How to Populate an Array with Random Numbers

1. Go to View/Command
2. Issue the command "import random" (without quotes)
      - this is necessary to give us access to random number generation in Python
	  - the data editor and command window share the same Python interpreter
	  - you can view the methods in the random module by using the command "print dir(random)"
3. Go to View/Data
4. Create an array (see How To Create a Two-Dimensional Array)
5. Go to the command bar of the array editor, field "exp:", type "random.randrange(1,50)" (without quotes) and press enter
	  - random values between 1 and 50 appear in the array
