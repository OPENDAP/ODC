--- Introduction ---

This program is the OPeNDAP Data Connector (ODC). Using the ODC's graphical 
interface you can search for and retrieve datasets published by OPeNDAP data 
servers. 

--- Installation ---

You can run the ODC from the CD (read-only mode) or from your hard drive. 
To install it on your hard drive move the folder ODC-2.59 to the location you 
desire on your hard drive. If you have downloaded the tar from the web site 
(rather than gotten the CD), change to the directory where you wish to install 
it and untar it. The typical command to do this is:

tar -zxvf ODC-2.59-unix.tar.gz

The distribution of the ODC requires a Java 1.5.0 later runtime to be installed
on the machine (see Java Runtime below).

--- Instant Startup ---

Go to the directory where the ODC was installed (or to the unix ODC directory 
on the CD if running from the CD) and execute the "startup" script in the main
directory (for example "sh startup").

--- Java Runtime ---

Type "java -version". It should list 1.5.0 or greater. If not you may need to 
install the runtime.

If the runtime is already on your system you may need only to set your PATH 
and JAVA_HOME environments correctly. For example, if the jdk is installed in 
/usr/java you might need to enter the following in your startup script:

set JAVA_HOME = /usr/java/jre1.5.0_04
set path=($JAVA_HOME/bin $path)

Check with your system administrator about using an existing installation of 
the Java runtime.

To install the Java runtime if you do you not already have one on your system 
go to:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0

and follow the instructions there for your system.

--- Running ---

If you are not running on x86 Linux or for some reason cannot or do not want 
to use the provided "startup" script you can start the ODC by executing the 
following command (one line):

java -Xms40m -Xmx300m -classpath  $:$/odc.jar:$/lib/opendap-0.0.0.jar:$/lib/jdom-b9.jar:$/lib/activation.jar:$/lib/mail.jar:$/lib/imap.jar:$/lib/mailapi.jar:$/lib/pop3.jar opendap.clients.odc.ApplicationController $

where "$" is the ODC base directory (contains odc.jar)

You should change the maximum memory (Xmx switch) to match your system's memory. For example if your system has 512 megabytes of memory you should change -Xmx300m to -Xmx512m

You may want to create an alias for this command.

--- Running with Exact Specification---

If your Java environment is not fixed or you do not want to use an environment
you can make an exact command to start the 1.5.0_04 Java and the program like 
this

/myjavadir/bin/java -Xms24m -Xmx500m -classpath "$/odc.jar:$/lib/opendap-0.0.0.jar:$/lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.4.jar:$/lib/jdom-b9.jar:$/lib/activation.jar:$/lib/mail.jar:$/lib/imap.jar:$/lib/mailapi.jar:$/lib/pop3.jar:/myjavadir/lib/ext/dnsns.jar:/myjavadir/lib/ext/ldapsec.jar:/myjavadir/lib/ext/sunjce_provider.jar:/myjavadir/lib/im/indicim.jar:/myjavadir/lib/im/thaiim.jar:/myjavadir/lib/jce.jar:/myjavadir/lib/plugin.jar:/myjavadir/lib/rt.jar:/myjavadir/lib/sunrsasign.jar:/myjavadir/lib/jsse.jar:/myjavadir/javaws/javaws.jar"  opendap.clients.odc.ApplicationController $

where /myjavadir is where your Jara runtime installation is located

where '$' is the directory where you have installed the program (but see note 
on base directory below).

Note that this command is specific to Java version 1.5.0 and may be different 
for other versions of the runtime.

--- Base Directory ---

The trailing '$' in the execution command above is an optional argument to the 
startup that tells the program the location of the "base directory". Normally 
this will be where you install the program. Note, however, that the program 
will create directories and files below this base directory. If for some 
reason you want to separate your program directory from your base directory do
the following: (1) untar to your program directory, (2) move all the files 
except the odc.jar and /lib directory files to the desired program files 
directory, and (3) in the java command above put the path to the program 
files directory where the trailing '$' is.

For example, imagine that you want to install the program to /usr/bin/odc but 
do not want the program creating files there. Instead you want the program to 
put its program files/directories in /var/odc. In this case put all files 
except the odc.jar and /lib directory in the /var/odc directory and then 
use /var/odc as your base directory. Your completed command line would look 
like this:

java -classpath /usr/bin/odc:/usr/bin/odc/odc.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/opendap-0.0.0.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/jdom-b9.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/activation.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/mail.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/imap.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/mailapi.jar:/usr/bin/odc/lib/pop3.jar opendap.clients.odc.ApplicationController /var/odc


--- Jar Replacement ---

When newer versions of the ODC are released you can update your system by 
replacing the jar file (odc.jar) from http://opendap.org/ODC/. The jar file 
will be a much smaller download than the entire package. If an accessory file,
such as the gazetteer, changes you can do a single file replacement the same 
way. See the accessory file link from the web page.
